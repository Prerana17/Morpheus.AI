Understanding pattern formation driven by cell–cell interactions has been a significant theme in cellular
biology for many years. In particular, due to their implications within many biological contexts, lateral-
inhibition mechanisms present in the Notch-Delta signalling pathway led to an extensive discussion between
biologists and mathematicians. Deterministic and stochastic models have been developed as a consequence
of this discussion, some of which address long-range signalling by considering cell protrusions reaching non-
neighbouring cells. The dynamics of such signalling systems reveal intricate properties of the coupling terms
involved in these models. In this work, we investigate the advantages and drawbacks of a single-parameter
long-range signalling model across diverse scenarios. By employing linear and multi-scale analyses, we discover
that pattern selection is not only partially explained but also depends on nonlinear effects that extend beyond
the scope of these analytical techniques.
1. Introduction
In epithelial tissue, depending on the nature of the contact between
cells, the Notch-Delta signalling pathway leads to fundamentally differ-
ent patterns [1–3]. In highly packed epithelial layers, some cells have
the ability to create extensions of themselves, developing protrusions
that reach non-neighbouring cells and yielding a new and fundamental
factor in the signalling dynamics. These basal actin-based filopodia are
elongated and oriented in different directions, extending signalling to
second or third neighbour cells [4–8].
In recent years, long-range signalling via filopodia has been shown
to significantly impact the distribution and sparse patterning of sensory
organ precursor (SOP) cells in the fly notum [9–11]. In other work,
spatiotemporal patterns of spinal neuron differentiation were revealed
to be mediated by basal protrusions [12]. In contrast to the frequently
observed short-ranged patterns induced by short-range signalling, cell
protrusions result in sparser SOP cell patterning.
The stochastic nature of these biological systems crucially affects
patterning. For example, noise arising from dynamic protrusions has
been shown to have a significant role in pattern refinement when
studying the organisation of bristles on the Drosophila melanogaster
notum [9]. A cellular automaton model of cell–cell signalling revealed
that rule-dependent structured noise also triggers refined and biased
patterning [10], hinting at the self-organising nature of such systems.
Intrinsic noise, driven by stochastic gene expression, has been studied
via the Chemical Langevin Equation [13] and shown to directly affect
juxtacrine-based pattern formation [14].

In addition to constructing realistic long-range signalling models
capable of numerically describing long-range patterning, linear stability
analysis (LSA) has revealed inherent characteristics of lateral inhibition
models [15–17]. Biased and long-range signalling was also studied
in [18], where weight-based coupling functions were considered for
several one-dimensional signalling systems. We aim to partially extend
this work by studying the two-dimensional hexagonal array under
specific signalling weights.
In 1996, Joanne Collier and colleagues developed the first model
of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition [19]. In this work, the authors
considered purely juxtacrine signalling dynamics, where the signalling
cell and the target cell are in direct physical contact. We define a model
of long-range Notch-Delta signalling, which is a relative weight-based
extension of the original Collier model, and name it the𝜖-Collier model.
We introduce a weighting parameter𝜖that relatively weights juxtacrine
and long-range signalling contributions, creating a complex non-local
signalling network.
Under different filopodium behaviour and lifespan assumptions, one
can explore the robustness of the extended Collier model via LSA,
providing a general framework for analysing autonomous systems of
signalling cells, as detailed in Supplementary Note 1 (SN1). Further-
more, such a parameterised model allows us to investigate the limits
on cell coupling sufficient to obtain long-range patterns. In parallel,
we explore the effects of stochastic filopodium dynamics on patterning.
Finally, we expand some of the techniques from LSA to describe a
general framework for multiple-scale methods and weakly nonlinear

stability analysis (WNSA) of coupled and decoupled dynamical systems
(SN2).
In this paper, we first present the Collier model of Notch-Delta
signalling, followed by its extension to long-range signalling, which we
call the 𝜖-Collier model. We then perform a linear stability analysis
of this system. The results of the LSA are compared with numerical
simulations. The cases of longer/oriented protrusions and stochastic
protrusions are analysed. In the latter case, we assume that protrusions
link and unlink at random. Stochastic protrusions can lead to pattern
refinement over time. We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of
the 𝜖-Collier model, showing which modes are expected to grow near
a bifurcation, and show that these accurately predict the results of
numerical simulations there. Finally, we present a multiscale method
for analysing weakly nonlinear dynamics, and show that it is difficult
to apply to this system.
2. Main methods
2.1. Lateral inhibition
We consider a periodic 𝑁× 𝑀 hexagonal lattice (hexagonal torus),
where each cell has6 neighbouring cells (see Fig. 1(a)). For a given cell,
we assume juxtacrine signalling occurs with all 6 of its neighbours via
the usual Collier model [19]. Here, the authors used experimental data
to build an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of the feedback
loop between two adjacent cells induced by Notch signalling (lateral
inhibition). The model consists of a system of coupled ODEs per cell.
Denoting by 𝑛𝑖 and 𝑑𝑖 the levels of Notch and Delta activity in cell 𝑖,
we have the following system
𝑑
𝑑𝑡𝑛𝑖 = 𝑓(⟨𝑑𝑖⟩) −𝑛𝑖 (1)
𝑑
𝑑𝑡𝑑𝑖 = 𝜈(𝑔(𝑛𝑖) −𝑑𝑖), (2)
where 𝑓,𝑔 ∶ [0,∞) → [0,∞) are continuous increasing and decreasing
functions, respectively, often taken to be Hill functions
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥𝑘
𝑎+ 𝑥𝑘 (3)
𝑔(𝑥) = 1
1 +𝑏𝑥ℎ (4)
for 𝑥≥ 0 and ℎ,𝑘 ≥ 1. 𝑟𝑡 ≡ 1∕𝑎and 𝑏are the trans-interactions strength
and ligand inhibition strength parameters, respectively 1. 𝜈 >0 is the
ratio between Notch and Delta decay rates, determining the strength
of decay. Finally, ⟨𝑑𝑖⟩ is the average level of Delta activity in the cells
adjacent to cell 𝑖, that is,
⟨𝑑𝑖⟩ = 1
|𝐧𝐧(𝑖)|
∑
𝑗∈𝐧𝐧(𝑖)
𝑑𝑗, (5)
where the sum is taken over the nearest neighbours 𝐧𝐧(𝑖) of cell 𝑖 and
|𝐧𝐧(𝑖)| is the total number of neighbours. In general, depending on the
hexagonal lattice orientation, either 𝑁 or 𝑀 must be even to ensure
periodicity. From the previous equations, one can see that the rate of
production of Notch activity is an increasing function of the level of
Delta activity in neighbouring cells. In contrast, the rate of production
of Delta activity is a decreasing function of the level of activated Notch
within the same cell. The production of Notch and Delta activity is
balanced by decay.
1 The quantity 𝑎1∕𝑘 is the neighbour Delta activity level necessary for half-
maximal Notch activation, while 𝑏−1∕ℎ is the Notch activity level necessary for
half-maximal Delta inhibition.
2.2. Long-range signalling
In addition to lateral cell–cell signalling, we also consider the pos-
sibility of long-range signalling with respect to non-neighbouring cells.
We loosely refer to cell protrusions as the main mechanism for general,
isotropic long-range signalling, interchangeably using these terms. A
detailed discussion of protrusion dynamics is presented in [20]. For
now, our notion of protrusions remains relatively abstract. There are
several ways to implement protrusion-cell signalling. As a first simplifi-
cation, we assume⟨𝑑𝑖⟩is the only term affected by long-range signalling
and extend its definition to include non-neighbouring cells that contact
cell 𝑖. We also investigate the cases where ligand density decays with
distance and protrusions are stochastic.
In general, we consider the approach suggested in [18]. Here, the
authors used a weighting function 𝜔(𝑠,𝑟) defining the signalling level
from a signaller cell 𝑠to a receiver cell 𝑟. 𝜔determines which cells are
connected through protrusions, defining a connectivity matrix whose
entries yield the signalling intensity. In a simplistic protrusion model,
all non-zero entries of such a matrix are equal. The weighting function
𝜔captures the matrix information, and we may rewrite the interaction
term as follows
⟨𝑑𝑖⟩ =
∑
𝑗∈𝐧(𝑖)
𝜔(𝑖,𝑗)𝑑𝑗, (6)
where the sum is made over the neighbours of 𝑖, 𝐧𝐧(𝑖), and the non-
neighbouring cells that are reached by the protrusions, 𝐧𝐩(𝑖), of cell
𝑖. Such an array of indexes is defined as 𝐧(𝑖) = 𝐧𝐧(𝑖) ∪ 𝐧𝐩(𝑖). The
further assumption that each cell has a finite amount of active ligand
to distribute at any given time point results in the following restriction
∑
𝑗∈𝐧(𝑖)
𝜔(𝑖,𝑗) =𝜔< +∞. (7)
Although there is some freedom in the interpretation of 𝜔, we assume
𝜔= 1for simplicity.
2.3. The 𝜖-Collier model
Our model, hereafter named the 𝜖-Collier model, extends the math-
ematical systems in [19] by considering the inclusion of long-range
signalling via protrusions balanced by the relative weighting factor 𝜖∈
[0,1]. We begin by weighting each signalling contribution, juxtacrine
(𝜔𝐽) and protrusion-based (𝜔𝑃), by the factor 𝜖, to define the combined
weighting function
𝜔≡ (1 −𝜖)𝜔𝐽 + 𝜖𝜔𝑃. (8)
Eq. (6)–Eq. (8) define the 𝜖-Collier model, considering protrusions of
relative signalling intensity𝜖. Naturally, Eq. (8) is only interesting when
𝜔𝐽 and 𝜔𝑃 are restricted to 𝐧𝐧(𝑖) and 𝐧𝐩(𝑖), respectively. For example,
the case 𝜖 = 0 and 𝜔𝐽(𝑖,𝑗) = 𝜒𝐧𝐧(𝑖)(𝑗)∕6, where 𝜒𝐧𝐧(𝑖) is the indicator
(or characteristic) function of the set 𝐧𝐧(𝑖), corresponds to the original
Collier model.
2.4. Coupling dynamics
We perform a linear stability analysis to understand the criteria for
pattern formation driven by Notch-Delta signalling. This is a useful tool
to not only identify the regions of the parameter space for which spon-
taneous patterning of SOP cells occurs but also to determine the typical
spacing between Delta-expressing cells, often called the characteristic
length of the pattern or pattern wavelength [15,17,19]. Our analysis
closely follows the methods outlined in [18,19,21] and Murray [22], for
the two-dimensional hexagonal array, and is based on the framework
presented in SN1.
Eq. (1)–Eq. (2) possesses a single positive homogeneous steady state
(𝑛∗,𝑑∗). At this state, we have 𝑓(𝑔(𝑛∗)) = 𝑛∗ and 𝑔(𝑛∗) = 𝑑∗, which is
unique because 𝑓(𝑔(𝑛)) is monotonically decreasing for all 𝑛≥ 0. Then,

arbitrary values close to the homogeneous steady state (𝑛∗,𝑑∗) ≃ (0.744,0.055).
for small perturbations ̃ 𝑛𝑖 = 𝑛𝑖 − 𝑛∗ and ̃𝑑𝑖 = 𝑑𝑖 − 𝑑∗, linearisation leads
to
𝑑
𝑑𝑡 ̃ 𝑛𝑖 = 𝐴⟨ ̃𝑑𝑖⟩− ̃ 𝑛𝑖 (9)
𝑑
𝑑𝑡
̃𝑑𝑖 = 𝜈𝐵̃ 𝑛𝑖 − 𝜈 ̃𝑑𝑖, (10)
where 𝐴 = 𝑓′(𝑔(𝑛∗)) is the signal trans-activation by the ligand and
𝐵= 𝑔′(𝑛∗) is the ligand inhibition by the signal. For a 𝑁× 𝑀 periodic
hexagonal lattice, with 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑁 and 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑀, the perturbations
can be written as a discrete Fourier series
̃ 𝑛𝑖 ≡ ̃ 𝑛𝑗,𝑘 =
𝑁∑

̃𝑑𝑖 ≡ ̃𝑑𝑗,𝑘 =
𝑁∑

𝑝=1
𝜂𝑞,𝑝𝑒2𝜋i(𝑞𝑗∕𝑁+𝑝𝑘∕𝑀), (12)
where two subindexes have been used to refer to the spatial position of
cell 𝑖 within the two-dimensional hexagonal lattice (see Fig. 1(b)). For
1 ≤ 𝑞≤ 𝑁 and 1 ≤ 𝑝≤ 𝑀, the inverted transform is
𝜉𝑞,𝑝 = 1

𝑀∑
𝑘=1
𝑁∑
𝑗=1
̃𝑑𝑗,𝑘𝑒−2𝜋i(𝑞𝑗∕𝑁+𝑝𝑘∕𝑀). (14)
Finally, applying this change of variables to Eq. (9)–Eq. (10) leads to
the following linear system of coupled ordinary differential equations
𝑑
𝑑𝑡
(𝜉𝑞,𝑝
𝜂𝑞,𝑝
)
= 𝐿
(𝜉𝑞,𝑝
𝜂𝑞,𝑝
)
, (15)
where matrix 𝐿is a specification of matrix 𝐋̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝in Eq. (S43), defined as
𝐿=
(−1 𝐴𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝
𝜈𝐵 −𝜈
)
(16)
and 𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝is the function that takes into account the spatial coupling
terms of Eq. (9)–Eq. (10) within the hexagonal lattice (in this case,
𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝∝ [𝜴̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝
]
12, defined by Eq. (S42)). We have then turned Eq. (1)–
Eq. (2) into a system of constant-coefficient linear differential equations
described by Eq. (15), which has a straightforward family of solutions.
For now, however, we focus on the coupling function𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝, which holds
the main mechanisms behind the dynamics of juxtacrine and long-range
signalling in our system.
𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝varies according to the weighting function 𝜔. Here, ̄ 𝑞= 𝑞∕𝑁
and ̄ 𝑝= 𝑝∕𝑀 define the discrete wavenumbers (Fourier modes) and
thus solutions for 0 < ̄ 𝑞, ̄ 𝑝≤ 1 correspond to patterned solutions
with corresponding pattern wavelengths (1∕ ̄ 𝑞,1∕ ̄ 𝑝). We assume that
connections between cells depend only on their relative positions in the
lattice (Fig. 1(b)) and therefore, for a sender cell 𝑠in position (𝑗,𝑘) and
a receiver cell 𝑟in position (𝑗′,𝑘′), we set 𝜔(𝑠𝑗,𝑘,𝑟𝑗′,𝑘′ ) ≡ 𝜔(𝑗′ −𝑗,𝑘′ −𝑘) =
𝜔(𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘). Hence, 𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝is, in general, given by
𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝=
∑
𝛥𝑗𝑘∈𝑆
𝜔(𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘)𝑒2𝜋i( ̄ 𝑞𝛥𝑗+ ̄ 𝑝𝛥𝑘), (17)
where 𝛥𝑗𝑘 = (𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘). Now, if we assume connections are symmetric,
i.e, 𝜔(𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘) =𝜔(−𝛥𝑗,−𝛥𝑘), we have, by Example 1.1 in SN1,
𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝=
∑
𝛥𝑗𝑘∈𝑆
𝜔(𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘) cos(2𝜋( ̄ 𝑞𝛥𝑗+ ̄ 𝑝𝛥𝑘)). (18)
The diagonalisation of 𝐿 leads to the temporal eigenvalues

Then, since 𝜈 >0, 𝜆+
̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝is a positive real number if and only if 𝐴𝐵𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝>
1. 𝐴 and 𝐵 are the slopes of the feedback functions 𝑓 and 𝑔 at the
homogeneous steady state and |𝐴𝐵|is defined as the feedback strength.
If |𝐴𝐵| = 0, then the homogeneous solution is linearly stable, Re(𝜆±
̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝) <
0, and thus no periodic pattern is expected to emerge. On the other
hand, the feedback strength has to be sufficiently high for patterns to
arise, that is, |𝐴𝐵| >||1∕𝛺min||, where 𝛺min denotes the minimum of the
real function 𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝, so that Re (𝜆+
̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝) is maximal. With 𝐴 >0, 𝐵 <0 and
assuming 𝛺min <0, we expect patterned solutions provided
𝐴𝐵 < 1
𝛺min
. (20)
In particular, this feedback is controlled by the tuple (𝑎,𝑏,ℎ,𝑘 ) as
follows
𝐴= 𝑓′(𝑔(𝑛∗)) = 𝑎𝑘𝑑∗𝑘−1
(𝑎+ 𝑑∗𝑘)2 (21)
𝐵= 𝑔′(𝑛∗) = − 𝑏ℎ𝑛∗ℎ−1
(1 +𝑏𝑛∗ℎ)2 , (22)
where, again, (𝑛∗,𝑑∗) is the homogeneous steady state, 𝑟𝑡 = 1∕𝑎 is
the trans-interactions strength and 𝑏 is the ligand inhibition strength.
(𝑛∗,𝑑∗) can be found by setting ⟨𝑑𝑖⟩ = 𝑑𝑖 and finding the intersection
of the nullclines 𝑛𝑖 = 𝑓(𝑑𝑖) and 𝑑𝑖 = 𝑔(𝑛𝑖). Assuming for convenience
ℎ= 𝑘, this can be rewritten as
𝑛∗ = 𝑓(𝑔(𝑛∗)) (23)
𝑑∗ = 𝑔(𝑛∗), (24)
which can be numerically solved for each triple (ℎ,𝑟𝑡,𝑏) in the param-
eter space. Such a solution, together with Eq. (20), defines the discrete
analogues of Turing spaces consisting of 𝑟𝑡 − 𝑏 = ℎ parameter regions
where spontaneous patterns occur. Outside such regions, pattern forma-
tion is not expected, since all of the linear modes have negative growth
rates.
We now explore different weighting functions to capture the effects
of juxtacrine signalling and protrusions, and discuss what features
of 𝜔 affect 𝛺min. We recall that 𝜔 determines the family of systems
Eq. (1)–Eq. (2) via the weighting dynamics defined by Eq. (6)–Eq. (8).
For a given cell on a hexagonal lattice, we denote the closest ring
of order 𝑘 ∈ N0 by 𝑅𝑘, such that 𝑅0 is the cell itself, 𝑅1 are its 6
neighbouring cells, 𝑅2 is the ring of 12 second-neighbour cells, and so
forth. Notice that |𝑅𝑘| = 6𝑘 (𝑘 >0). We further expand the definition
of 𝑆 in SN1 by defining 𝑆𝑘 as the relative index set of cells in 𝑅𝑘
(according to Fig. 1(b)), that is,
⎧

𝑆2 = {(0,±2),(±2,0),±(1,−1),
± (1,2),±(2,1),±(2,2)}
⋮
. (25)
This notation will be used throughout this work. Notice that such
a definition can be ambiguous in different contexts, as discussed in
Remark 1.2 (SN1).
3. Results
3.1. Juxtacrine signalling and simplistic protrusions
For juxtacrine signalling on a hexagonal lattice, without protrusions,
we set
𝜔𝐽(𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘) =
{1
6 if (𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘) ∈𝑆1,
0 otherwise,
(26)
so that
𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝= 1
3 [cos (2𝜋̄ 𝑞) + cos(2𝜋̄ 𝑝) + cos(2𝜋( ̄ 𝑞+ ̄ 𝑝))] . (27)
Notice that 𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝takes discrete values within the interval [−0.5,1].
The modes that minimise Eq. (27) are those for which 𝑁 and 𝑀
are multiples of 3, thus ( ̄ 𝑞, ̄ 𝑝) ∈ {(1∕3,1∕3),(2∕3,2∕3)} and a pattern
with wavelength 3 along the main directions of the hexagonal lattice
emerges, provided 𝐴𝐵 <−2. In general, and depending on the initial
conditions, such patterns may yield 1, 2 or 3 different cell types, as
discussed in more detail below.
Considering protrusions, we first look at the more straightfor-
ward case where only the first ring of 12 non-neighbouring cells, 𝑅2,
is reached by protrusions. Here, signalling is weighted laterally by
Eq. (26) and on 𝑅2 by
𝜔𝑃(𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘) =
{ 1
12 if (𝛥𝑗,𝛥𝑘) ∈𝑆2,
0 otherwise.
(28)
Figs. 1(c)–1(f) show the observable patterns for different values of 𝜖,
with initial conditions near the homogeneous steady state, obtained
by solving Eq. (23)–Eq. (24). Notice that the limit case 𝜖 = 1 has the
extreme feature of no juxtacrine signalling, hence the small clusters of
Delta-expressing cells in Fig. 1(f). Even for small values of 𝜖, sparse
patterns are evident.
We may then weight each signalling contribution with a factor𝜖 >0
and define the combined weighting function 𝜔= (1 −𝜖)𝜔𝐽 +𝜖𝜔𝑃. Using
this leads to
𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝= (1 −𝜖)
3 [cos (2𝜋̄ 𝑞) + cos(2𝜋̄ 𝑝) + cos(2𝜋( ̄ 𝑞+ ̄ 𝑝))]
+ 𝜖
6
[
cos (4𝜋̄ 𝑞) + cos(2𝜋( ̄ 𝑝− ̄ 𝑞)) + cos(4𝜋̄ 𝑝)
+ cos(2𝜋(2 ̄ 𝑞+ ̄ 𝑝)) + cos(2𝜋( ̄ 𝑞+ 2̄ 𝑝))
+ cos(4𝜋( ̄ 𝑞+ ̄ 𝑝))
]
. (29)
In this case, minimising 𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝is trickier and therefore we consider
a numerical approach. For different values of the long-range signalling
strength 𝜖, Fig. 2(a) shows the change of 1∕|𝛺min| for increasing values
of 𝜖. Notice that 𝛺max = 1 for all 𝜖. Equal juxtacrine-protrusion
weighting occurs when 𝜖 = 2∕3 (𝛺min(2∕3) ≃ −0.24). For each 𝜖, the
number of modes varies, as seen in Fig. 2(b). Notice that𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝= 𝛺1− ̄ 𝑞,1− ̄ 𝑝
and, in fact, 𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝is symmetric with respect to the planes ̄ 𝑞= ̄ 𝑝and
̄ 𝑞= 1 −̄ 𝑝for all 𝜖. An interesting observation is that at around 𝜖 = 0.4
there are a total of8 minimising modes, contrasting to the single pair of
modes for 𝜖 <0.4 and the 6 distinct modes for 𝜖 >0.4 (Figs. 2(d)–2(f),
Video S1). The bifurcation observed in Fig. 2(b) at 𝜖= 0.4 is predicted
independently of the Hill functions, and can be mathematically shown
by solving, for 𝜖,
𝛺1
3 ,1
3
(𝜖) =𝛺̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝(𝜖) (30)
and a minimising pair ( ̄ 𝑞, ̄ 𝑝) ∉ {(1∕3 ,1∕3),(2∕3,2∕3)} (see SN1 for
details). Figs. 2(g)–2(i) show some of the simulations for corresponding
values of 𝜖.
As discussed before, the critical wave numbers maximise the real
part of the temporal eigenvectors. Equivalently, Fig. 2(c) shows
max ̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝Re(𝜆±
̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝) as a function of the relative weight parameter 𝜖, cor-
responding to the critical 𝐴𝐵 = 1∕(max 𝜖 𝛺min) ≃ −5 .207. Here,
max ̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝(Re(𝜆±
̄ 𝑞,̄ 𝑝)) >0 for all 𝜖, and thus patterns are expected to emerge
with the maximising wavelength modes. As suggested by Eq. (21)–
Eq. (24), we may go a step further and work out the specific parameter
regions for which |𝐴𝐵| yields pattern formation. The phase diagrams
in Fig. 3 (Video S2) represent the regions in the 𝑟𝑡 − 𝑏 plane such that
𝐴𝐵 <1∕𝛺min(𝜖), or more specifically,
𝑛∗1−ℎ𝑑∗1−𝑘((1 +𝑏𝑛∗ℎ)(𝑎+ 𝑑∗𝑘))2 <−𝑎𝑏ℎ𝑘𝛺min(𝜖) (31)
for different values of 𝛺min and corresponding 𝜖. The 𝜖-Collier model
is robust with respect to the pair (𝑟𝑡,𝑏), corresponding to the trans-
interactions strength and ligand inhibition strength parameters, respec-
tively. Increasing 𝜖 from zero initially reduces the size of the discrete
