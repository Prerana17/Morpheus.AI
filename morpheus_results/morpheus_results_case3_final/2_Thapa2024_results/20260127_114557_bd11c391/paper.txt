ABSTRACT
Neural tube closure is a critical morphogenetic event during early vertebrate development. This complex process 
is susceptible to perturbation by genetic errors and chemical disruption, which can induce severe neural tube 
defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida. We built a computational agent-based model (ABM) of neural tube devel -
opment based on the known biology of morphogenetic signals and cellular biomechanics underlying neural fold 
elevation, bending and fusion. The computer model functionalizes cell signals and responses to render a dynamic 
representation of neural tube closure. Perturbations in the control network can then be introduced synthetically 
or from biological data to yield quantitative simulation and probabilistic prediction of NTDs by incidence and 
degree of defect. Translational applications of the model include mechanistic understanding of how singular or 
combinatorial alterations in gene-environmental interactions and animal-free assessment of developmental 
toxicity for an important human birth defect (spina bifida) and potentially other neurological problems linked to 
development of the brain and spinal cord.
Introduction
Critical to embryonic development of the brain and spinal cord is 
elevation and folding of the neural plate into a neural tube. This process, 
neural tube closure, occurs between day 23 and day 30 of human 
gestation ( Gilbert et al. ). Its failure underlies neural tube defects (NTDs) 
such as spina bifida and anencephaly. With an estimated global inci -
dence of 20 cases per 10,000 live-births, NTDs are among the most 
prevalent human congenital malformations ( Kancherla, 2023 ). In -
dividuals born with NTDs are known to have severe neurological and 
developmental problems.
Neural tube closure is a tightly regulated process that involves the 
coordinated action of various signaling pathways and cellular processes. 
This system is susceptible to disruptions, including genetic variations 
that alter the normal function of key genes involved in the process, and 
environmental factors such as chemical exposures ( Kancherla, 2023; 
Heusinkveld et al., 2021; Nikolopoulou et al., 2017 ). Exposure to 
chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and industrial chem -
icals, increases the risk of NTDs ( Felisbino et al., 2024; Brender et al., 
2014; Yazdy et al., 2013; Rull et al., 2006; Mulu et al., 2022; Lupo et al., 
2011; Isakovi ´c et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023 ). Therefore, these 
chemicals warrant attention in safety assessments traditionally con -
ducted in guideline prenatal development studies, such as OECD 414 
and OPPTS 870.3700 ( OECD, 2018; EPA, 1998 ). However, there is an 
increasing demand for alternative approaches due to ethical concerns, 
the call for greater chemical coverage with fewer resources, and scien -
tific arguments related to the limited predictability of animal models for 
human health ( Kiani, et al., 2022; Piersma, 2006; Piersma et al., 2019 ).
Various in vitro alternatives for developmental toxicity testing have 
been developed during the past decades. These alternatives are often

based on pluripotent stem cells, small model organisms such as the 
zebrafish, and complex organoid or in vitro engineered microsystems 
( Xue et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2010; Dreser et al., 2020; McCollum et al., 
2011; Van Der Ven et al., 2022; Karzbrun et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2024; 
Knight et al., 2018 ). These approaches may replicate some key aspects of 
neural tube development (e.g., neuruloids, neural rosettes), offering a 
window into the potential teratogenic effects leading to NTDs. Despite 
advancements, it is still challenging to capture the complex interactions 
and integrative biology of in vivo mammalian development.
Computational agent-based models (ABMs) are a method in which 
individual entities, or agents — specifically cells in this context — are 
simulated to mimic and study complex behaviors. These models put 
cellular dynamics in motion to reproduce self-organizing and emergent 
phenotypes designed in a computer model to enable the prediction of 
systems-level outcomes linked to defined biomolecular abnormalities 
( Hutson et al., 2017; Kleinstreuer et al., 2013; Swat et al., 2012; Shir -
inifard et al., 2012 ). For example, the models developed for blood vessel 
formation and palatal fusion have demonstrated how genetic and 
chemical perturbations, represented by adjusted fold changes in key 
genes, can predict adverse outcomes observed in vivo ( Hutson et al., 
2017; Kleinstreuer et al., 2013 ). This approach provides valuable 
understanding of the mechanisms and vulnerabilities of these develop -
mental processes. When designed with sufficient biological accuracy, 
ABMs can probabilistically assess the impact of perturbations on neural 
tube closure. This offers insights into mechanisms underlying neural 
tube closure and potential disruption of this process by chemical or 
genetic factors.
In this study, we present a new computational ABM that re -
capitulates the morphogenetic events driving mammalian neural tube 
closure, using the open source CompuCell3D modeling environment 
( Swat et al., 2012 ). Our ABM is based on the physiological map of 
mammalian neural tube closure we developed earlier, which systemat -
ically organizes the cellular and molecular interactions driving this 
process ( Heusinkveld et al., 2021 ). This map serves as a reference tool 
for identifying critical pathways and integrating them into the ABM. 
Here, we show how variations in cell signals and responses may lead to 
alterations reminiscent of NTDs that can be calibrated to in vivo models 
(mouse, zebrafish). Additionally, the computer model can offer mech -
anistic insights often obscured in traditional animal models to bridge the 
gap between a molecular alteration and a developmental phenotype.

Results
A computational model of the mammalian neural tube closure
We built a multi-scale model of mammalian neural tube closure using 
CompuCell3D, an open-source platform that simulates multicellular 
systems based on a Cellular Potts model. The platform takes into account 
the specific behaviors of cells, their regulatory signals, and physical 
properties ( Swat, et al., 2012 ). Neural tube closure involves complex 
tissue morphogenesis where tissue bending plays an essential role. This 
bending is primarily driven by apical constriction of cells in the neuro -
epithelium. The collective changes shape the tissue at emergent hinge 
points (bending points) ( Nikolopoulou et al., 2017 ). The current model 
is two-dimensional in the dorso-ventral plane representing the mid- 
lumbar region of the neural tube. Within this region, both median 
hinge points (MHPs) and dorsolateral hinge points (DLHPs) are present 
during neural tube closure ( Juriloff and Harris, 2018 ).
The stepwise progression of the model is shown in Fig. 1 . It starts as a 
planar neural plate, measuring 252 µ m by 50 µ m by 1 µ m , and over the 
course of 50 simulated hours undergoes the morphogenetic changes 
necessary to form a closed neural tube ( Cork and Gasser, 2012 ). The 
start of the model approximates gestational day 28, Carnegie Stage 10 in 
human development. To make the model as human-like as possible, we 
adjusted its physical properties, time constraints and spatial organiza -
tion to closely represent the characteristics of human neural tube closure 
( Cork and Gasser, 2012 ). Executing the computer model simulates key 
morphogenetic events akin to those seen in reconstructed sections of the 
embryo ( Cork and Gasser, 2012 ). These events are directly driven by a 
gene regulatory network that is embedded in each cell featured in the 
ABM ( Fig. 2 ). Below we describe the biological processes that occur 
during neural tube closure and are incorporated in our model, which 
progress through six distinct stages.
In the first stage, molecular protein signals shape the initial 
morphogenesis. The notochord starts to produce sonic hedgehog (SHH), 
which activates Patched Homolog 1 (PTCH1) ( Aruga, 2004; Caspary and 
Anderson, 2003 ). PTCH1 downregulates Zinc finger proteins (ZIC) and 
upregulates Glioma-associated oncogene 2 (GLI2) proteins, which 
inhibit ZIC ( Fig. 2 ) ( Aruga, 2004; Caspary and Anderson, 2003; Copp 
and Greene, 2010 ). This starts apical constriction and the formation of 
median hinge-point cells in the targeted region ( Caspary and Anderson, 
2003; Copp and Greene, 2010 ). Opposing the SHH gradient is the Bone 
morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) gradient, secreted by the surface 
ectoderm ( Copp and Greene, 2010; Liu and Niswander, 2005; Sheng 
et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2016 ). BMP4 induces cell proliferation in 
the mesoderm and activates the BMP receptor (BMPR) ( Sheng et al., 
2010; Anderson et al., 2016; Chesnutt et al., 2004; Sakurai et al., 2012 ). 
BMP4 activity is regulated by fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and 
Noggin (NOG). FGF8, which levels are highest in the first stage, directly 
inhibits BMP4 gene expression ( Fig. 2 ). NOG, secreted by the mesoderm, 
neuroectoderm, and notochord, acts as a ligand that binds to BMP4, 
forming an inactive NOG-BMP4 complex ( Fig. 2 ) ( Felder et al., 2002; 
Phan-Everson et al., 2021; Zimmerman et al., 1996 ). The surface ecto -
derm also secretes WNT, which activates the Frizzled (FZD) receptor to 
start the cascade of events leading to neural crest cell delamination 
( Nikolopoulou et al., 2017; Gray et al., 2013; Pera et al., 2014 ). How -
ever, early neural crest specification and delamination is inhibited by 
the high levels of FGF8 ( Diez Del Corral and Morales, 2017 ). This is 
complemented by low levels of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), FGF8 ′ s 
regulatory counterpart ( Heusinkveld et al., 2021 ).
In the second stage, approximately 10 h into neural tube

development, the median hinge point cells anchor to the notochord 
beneath them and start to form the floor plate. The floor plate gives 
stability to the neural plate and starts to produce SHH, reinforcing the 
sustained SHH gradient along the ventral-dorsal axis ( Greene et al., 
1998 ). Floor plate formation in combination with further growth of the 
mesoderm results in the formation of a furrow at the midline of the 
model, the neural groove ( van Straaten et al., 1993 ). Meanwhile, 
physical forces outside of the neural plate are also at work. The surface 
ectoderm starts to push towards the midline of the neural tube 
( Schoenwolf and Alvarez, 1991 ). These forces are generated by the 
pressure of surrounding tissues or fluids and are critical for bending of 
the neural plate later in time. In our simulation, we approximated this 
behavior by applying a directional vector force on the surface ectoderm, 
which compels the surface ectoderm to move inward. This ensures that 
the neural tube invaginates into the embryo and not outward 
( Schoenwolf and Alvarez, 1991 ).
In the third stage, around 20 h into development, key molecular 
changes occur. ATRA levels continue to increase, exceeding FGF levels, 
while FGF levels further decrease ( Heusinkveld et al., 2021 ). This shift 
results in reduced NOG levels, subsequently increasing the amount of 
free active BMP4. Still, the NOG-BMP4 balance is maintained because 
BMP4 induces the production of NOG ( Felder et al., 2002; Phan-Everson 
et al., 2021 ). Somitogenesis commences and plays a critical role in 
shaping and stabilizing the neuroectodermal tissue. This contributes to 
the elevation of the neural folds by exerting physical forces that push up 
the neuroectoderm, thereby deepening the neural groove 
( Christodoulou and Skourides, 2023 ). During neural tube closure, so -
mite formation is initiated via an oscillatory mechanism, often referred 
to as the “segmentation clock”, in which the Notch, WNT and FGF 
pathways play a major role ( Gibb et al., 2010; Maroto et al., 2012 ). The 
computer model abstracts a segmentation clock without its regulators, 
as noted in the Methods section.
Around 30 h into development, the hallmark of the fourth stage is 
marked by the formation of dorsolateral hinge-points (DLHPs) at the 
neural plate’s upper regions. DLHP formation initiates bending of the 
neural plate via apical constriction, the formation of wedge-shaped cells. 
This process is driven by localized actomyosin contraction at the apical 
side of cells and is accompanied by cell elongation, as cell volume is 
redistributed along the apicobasal axis ( Sawyer et al., 2010 ). Basal 
thickening, with nuclei retained basally, further reinforces this wedge 
shape and stabilizes the hinge point structure. DLHP formation is highest 
in regions with intermediate BMP4 levels, where BMP signaling is 
inhibited by NOG, ensuring proper spatial localization ( Gilbert et al. ). In 
contrast, SHH signaling via PTCH acts as an inhibitor of DLHP forma -
tion, further refining their placement ( Stottmann et al., 2006; Ybot- 
Gonzalez et al., 2007 ). At this stage, the continuous downregulation of 
FGF and increasing activity of ATRA allows the start of the neural crest 
cell delamination cascade. The end of the cascade results in an E- to N- 
cadherin switch, which allows neural crest cells to delaminate. In our 
model we simplified this through a single Cadherin (CAD). When CAD 
expression is high, its properties approximate E-cadherin. Low expres -
sion switches to N-cadherin properties. The E/N Cadherin switch is 
inhibited by FGF8 and induced by BMP4, FZD, paired box gene 3 (PAX3) 
and snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (SNAI1), which is increasing 
in this stage ( Fig. 1 ) ( Gray et al., 2013; Pera et al., 2014; Ichi et al., 2010; 
Nakazaki et al., 2009 ).
In the fifth stage, around 40 h into development, the formation of 
DLHPs further progressed into the center region of the neural plate 
under the influence of an increasing BMP4 gradient ( Sheng et al., 2010; 
Anderson et al., 2016 ). This change, combined with the physical forces 
exerted by the surface ectoderm towards the midline, leads to near 
fusion of the surface ectoderm and neuroectoderm, almost closing the 
neural tube ( Schoenwolf and Alvarez, 1991 ). The rising FZD, PAX3 and 
SNAI1 levels cause the start of the neural crest cell delamination ( Gray 
et al., 2013; Pera et al., 2014; Ichi et al., 2010; Nakazaki et al., 2009 ).
After approximately 40–50 h of development, a section of the neural 
tube closes. The final stage displays 50 h into development, the neural 
tube is now fully closed, and the neural crest cells delaminated. A 
summary of all the signaling molecules and cell behaviors implemented 
in the computational model is presented in Table 1 .
Towards modeling neural tube closure defects
To calibrate our computational model against known biological data 
and explore potential developmental anomalies, we performed in silico 
parameter variation experiments. In these experiments nine different 
genes that participate in the regulation of the three key processes (floor 
plate formation, DLHPs formation, neural crest cell delamination) were 
hyperactivated or knocked out, while keeping the rest of the parameters 
the same. Each hyperactivation or knockout scenario was simulated 20 
times to calculate the probability of defect, with the standard error of the 
mean (SEM) calculated to represent variability across simulations. The 
results presented in the following sections are organized per morpho -
genetic event and offer insight in the predicted dynamics of neural tube 
closure. The series of images shown are examples of the most common 
outcomes ( Fig. 3 ). A summary of the in silico gene perturbation experi -
ments is presented in Supplementary Table 1 .
Floor plate formation
The floor plate is a specialized structure of the neural tube and is 
formed in the second stage of the neural tube closure. Floor plate for -
mation was disrupted in the model by knockout of SHH, PTCH1 or GLI2 
( Fig. 3 ). This prevented the neuroectoderm from anchoring to noto -
chord, which reduced the stability of the neural plate. As a result, 
structural malformations occurred at the midline of the neural tube.
Due to disruptions in floor plate formation, the strength of the SHH 
gradient along the ventral-dorsal axis was reduced. Due to the reduced 
SHH gradient (the inhibitor of DLHP formation), DLHP formation was 
increased near the ventral side of the tube. Due to increased DLHPs 
formation, the neural tube still managed to close in most cases. How -
ever, the lack of floor plate and reduced stability of the neuroectoderm 
reduced the size of the neural canal (the hollow part of the neural tube).

energy function. Specifically, changes that improve the pseudo energy 
always succeed, while those that worsen it may succeed based on a 
probability linked to the effective “ temperature ” (Teff), which was set to 
10 in our simulations. This value was chosen based on recommendations 
in the CompuCell3D manual to balance stochasticity and energy mini -
mization. This temperature introduces randomness in cellular motility 
and behavior, ensuring the model captures biological variability while 
preserving realistic dynamics ( Swat et al., 2012 ). Exact details of the 
modeling framework can be found in the Compucell3D manual on 
compucell3d.org and in Shirinfiard et al. 2012 ( Shirinifard et al., 2012 ). 
We quantified the dynamics in terms of Monte Carlo Steps (MCS), with 
each MCS involving 252 * 200 = 50400 change attempts. Each simu -
lation ran for a total of 12.000 Monte Carlo Steps (MCS), with one MCS 
representing 15 s real time for a total real time of 50 h. Up to 20 sim -
ulations were simultaneously ran locally on a 3.60 GHz intel core i7- 
12700KF processor, which took approximately 2 h to complete. We 
stored cell and field-lattice configurations every 25 simulated minutes 
(100 MCS) and rendered the snapshots using a home-written python 
script ( Figs. 1 and 3 ).
Model scope
Our model recapitulates a single dorso-ventral section of caudal 
neural tube closure, specifically the middle spinal region at somite lo -
cations 15 – 20. The model covers major morphogenetic events that 
revolve around the all- trans -retinoic acid (ATRA)-related molecular 
pathways for neural tube closure and disruption ( Heusinkveld et al., 
2021 ). These events include apical constriction, Floor plate formation, 
DLHPs formation, neural fold elevation, neural crest cell delamination, 
surface ectoderm fusion and somite formation. Here Floor plate forma -
tion, DLHPs formation and neural crest cell delamination are actively 
regulated by a constructed gene regulatory network ( Fig. 2 ). The model 
approximates a timeline from embryonic (E) days E8.5   E10 in the 
mouse and gestational days 28 – 31, Carnegie Stage (CS) CS10   CS12 in 
human development ( Cork and Gasser, 2012 ). Initial model size of 252 x 
50 was set based on CS10 sections of the caudal neural tube at the virtual 
human embryo project ( Cork and Gasser, 2012 ).
Model cell properties
We initialized the cell volume for the paraxial mesoderm, surface 
ectoderm, and neural crest cell types at 49, with a variance of plus or 
minus 10, and positioned them in a 7 by 7 µ m layout. This setup mirrors 
observations from the Virtual Human Embryo project ( Cork and Gasser, 
2012 ). We calibrated the delta cell volume increase to reflect a 24-hour 
proliferation rate without inducing cell proliferation. For the neuro -
ectoderm and median hinge point cell types, we divided each cell into 
basal, lateral, and apical sites, each spanning 7 by 7 µ m . These cells, as 
observed in the Virtual Human Embryo images, seemed elongated, being 
roughly three times longer than other cell types. To keep the neural plate 
structure stable and intact during the simulation, a minimum cell width 
of 7 µ m was essential, making our simulated neuroectoderm cells 
approximately 2 µ m wider than their estimated biological size. We 
ensured the structural integrity of the neural plate by connecting apical 
and basal cells within the neuroectodermal layer with springs, simu -
lating the role of tight junctions through the use of the Focal Point 
Plasticity plugin in CompuCell3D ( Swat et al., 2012 ). We set the target 
distance between these points at 5 µ m to create a stable neuroectodermal 
layer.
Model cell behavior
Apical Constriction in MHP formation: Apical constriction in the 
MHP is directly induced by SHH signaling secreted by the notochordal 
plate. When neuroectodermal cells are in contact with the notochord, 
the high SHH signaling triggers apical constriction via PTCH ( Fig. 2 ). 
When a cell undergoes apical constriction, the target distance of the 
mechanical springs on the apical side of the cell reduces from 5 µ m to 0 
µ m, implemented in steps of 0.005 µ m per MCS for stable dynamic 
transition. This reduction represents the constriction of the actomyosin 
machinery on the apical surface of the cell ( Cork and Gasser, 2012; 
Greene et al., 1998; Sawyer et al., 2010 ). To simulate the elongation of 
cells during apical constriction, additional mechanical springs are 
introduced between the apical and basal sides of the cell. These springs 
extend the target distance of the basal compartment to 15 µ m from an 
initial 9 µ m, reflecting the elongation behavior during apical constric -
tion ( Cork and Gasser, 2012; Sawyer et al., 2010 ). Simultaneously, cell 
volume is dynamically redistributed among three compartments (apical, 
lateral, and basal), increasing the basal compartment ’ s volume by 57 % 
while proportionally decreasing the apical compartment ’ s volume. This 
adjustment mimics basal thickening and the formation of wedge-shaped 
cells while maintaining the overall cell volume ( Gilbert et al.; Cork and 
Gasser, 2012 ).
Apical Constriction during DLPHs formation: Apical constriction 
during DLHPs formation in the neuroectoderm is an emergent feature 
induced by intermediate BMP4 levels and inhibited by SHH ( Fig. 2 ). 
While the behavior of cells undergoing apical constriction during DLHP 
formation resembles that during MHP formation, the triggering mech -
anisms differ. the first model calculates the maximum probability of 
apical constriction ( max
ac
) for each neuroectodermal cell at every MCS 
based on local BMP4 concentration using the equation: 
max
ac
= 4

)
(1) 
Here max
ac 
is the maximum apical constriction probability and C
bmp 
is 
the local BMP4 concentration. Next the inhibition of apical constriction 
by SHH (shh
aci
) is calculated using the equation: 
shh
aci
=
0 . 5
8
0 . 5
8
+ C
8
shh
(2) 
where shh
aci 
represents represents the level of apical constriction inhi -
bition by SHH and C
shh 
is the local SHH concentration. The combined 
probability of apical constriction ( rate
ac
) is then determined by multi -
plying the BMP4 and SHH effects: 
rat e
ac
= max
ac
*shh
aci
(3) 
This value ( rate
ac
) is subsequently corrected for time using a Poisson 
distribution: 
p
ac
= 1   exp
 
(
rat e ac
4
)
(4) 
Here p
ac 
represents the time-corrected probability of apical constriction. 
Upon successful apical constriction, the cell transitions one step closer to 
adopting a wedge-shaped morphology. If unsuccessful, the cell reverts 
one step towards its original shape. This stochastic approach captures 
the biological variability and dynamic nature of DLHP formation.
The segmentation clock: In our model, we implemented the seg -
mentation clock via an internal “ counter, ” that triggers the start of so -
mite formation after 17 h simulated time ( Cork and Gasser, 2012 ). Cells 
from the paraxial mesoderm type have a 1/2500 chance to differentiate 
to a somite cell with different properties. This probability is increased by 
1 %, each time a paraxial mesoderm cell contacts a somite cell. These 
parameters were arbitrarily chosen to ensure rapid somite formation 
while minimizing the amount of extracellular matrix (ECM) captured 
within these somites ( Martins et al., 2009 ). This implementation 
allowed us to reduce the complexity of the model while maintaining the 
critical function of the somites in neural tube closure.

A gene regulatory network that drives the neural tube closure model
To simulate the complex interplay between various genes and pro -
teins during neural tube closure in our model, we created a gene regu -
latory network of neural tube closure that contains key genes. All genes 
and proteins implemented in the model are displayed in the gene reg -
ulatory network ( Fig. 2 ). The gene regulatory network implemented in 
our model is a refined extraction from a larger network and embedded in 
each cell in the ABM ( Heusinkveld et al., 2021 ). Our network regulates 
three key processes for successful neural tube closure: ( Fig. 2 ) floor plate 
formation, DLHP formation and neural crest cell delamination ( Fig. 2 ). 
The development and simulation of this gene regulatory network, was 
conducted entirely within the CompuCell3D environment. As mecha -
nistic data of the human neural tube is scarce the network primarily 
relies on animal data.

In these equations: 
• x represents the gene expression level of the regulating gene (acti -
vator or inhibitor).
• K is the half-maximal constant.
• n is the Hill coefficient.
The Hill functions in the network are scaled between 0 and 1, with n 
= 8 and K = 0.5. These parameter values were selected due to the 
absence of precise values in existing data. To incorporate the inherent 
variability and unpredictability of biological systems, a random back -
ground transcription level is included for each gene in the network.
Protein gradients that are known to be critical for neural tube include 
BMP secreted by the surface ectoderm, SHH from the notochord and 
floor plate, NOG from the mesoderm, neuroectoderm, and floor plate, 
and WNT from the surface ectoderm. The protein concentration of these 
gradients is scaled between 0 and 1, a similar scaling as the gene regu -
latory network. We normalized the protein gradients by selecting 
identical values for each gradient for the diffusion and decay constant. 
The diffusion constant for all protein gradients was parameterized to be 
0.24 µ m ( Kancherla, 2023 )/s. The decay constant was parameterized to 
be 3.33*10

in all compartments but increased to 2.333*10

in 
the medium compartment (all values scaled to the simulation ’ s time and 
space units). This ensured consistent behavior of these signaling mole -
cules across different cell types and spatial locations. Then, we cali -
brated the secretion constants based on cell number to accurately reflect 
the biological context (exact parameter values can be found in the 
simulation ’ s parameter file). The rostro-caudal gradients: ATRA and FGF 
are fixed in space, meaning their concentrations are the same 
throughout the model, but vary over time. Specifically, FGF concen -
tration decreases over time and ATRA increases, both scaled between 
0 and 1. This design mimics the rostro-caudal protein balance of FGF- 
ATRA crucial for neural tube closure, and ensures that these gradients 
capture the temporal dynamics needed for patterning in this 2D 
framework ( Heusinkveld et al., 2021 ).
