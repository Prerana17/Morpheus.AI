Abstract
Ovarian cancer is amongst the most morbid of gynecological malignancies due to its diagnosis at an advanced stage, a 
transcoelomic mode of metastasis, and rapid transition to chemotherapeutic resistance. Like all other malignancies, the 
progression of ovarian cancer may be interpreted as an emergent outcome of the conflict between metastasizing cancer cells 
and the natural defense mounted by microenvironmental barriers to such migration. Here, we asked whether senescence 
in coelom-lining mesothelia, brought about by drug exposure, affects their interaction with disseminated ovarian cancer 
cells. We observed that cancer cells adhered faster on senescent human and murine mesothelial monolayers than on non-
senescent controls. Time-lapse epifluorescence microscopy showed that mesothelial cells were cleared by a host of cancer 
cells that surrounded the former, even under sub-confluent conditions. A multiscale computational model predicted that 
such colocalized mesothelial clearance under sub-confluence requires greater adhesion between cancer cells and senescent 
mesothelia. Consistent with the prediction, we observed that senescent mesothelia expressed an extracellular matrix with 
higher levels of fibronectin, laminins and hyaluronan than non-senescent controls. On senescent matrix, cancer cells adhered 
more efficiently, spread better, and moved faster and persistently, aiding the spread of cancer. Inhibition assays using RGD 
cyclopeptides suggested the adhesion was predominantly contributed by fibronectin and laminin. These findings led us to 
propose that the senescence-associated matrisomal phenotype of peritoneal barriers enhances the colonization of invading 
ovarian cancer cells contributing to the metastatic burden associated with the disease.

Introduction
The high morbidity associated with epithelial ovarian can-
cer (EOC) is due to its ability to rapidly metastasize and 
colonize the visceral peritoneum. Transformed cells at 
the primary site are shed into the peritoneal cavity via the 
movement of peritoneal fluid. Ovarian cancer cells adhere 
to the lining of the peritonea [1, 2], retract mesothelial cells 
[3], and actively degrade the underlying and exposed extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) by expressing proteolytic enzymes 
such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [2]. Management 
of EOC involves surgical cytoreduction with chemotherapy 
provided before or/and after surgery [4]. Cytotoxic therapeu-
tics commonly employed in EOC are carboplatin and doxo-
rubicin, which bind to and alkylate DNA, and paclitaxel, 
which binds to tubulin and prevents karyokinesis. Treatment 
with these agents inhibits cell division and ultimately leads 
to cell death. However, exposure to such drugs may also 
induce a cytostatic (as opposed to cytotoxic) state in both 
cancer and primary cells, also known as senescence, wherein 
the cells are metabolically active but growth-arrested. Ther-
apy-induced senescence (TIS) has been proposed to suppress 
tumor cell proliferation [5 ]. On the other hand, it has also 
been shown to potentiate tumor heterogeneity, resistance [6], 
and relapse [7 ]. For instance, TIS in ovarian cancer cells

leads to their transient dormancy, which can be reversed to 
re-initiate proliferation [8, 9]. TIS-associated cytokine secre-
tion (as part of the broader phenomenon of senescence-asso-
ciated secretory phenotype or SASP) may accentuate infiltra-
tion by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in primary 
tumors leading to greater invasion and metastasis [10– 12].
Exposure to therapeutic drugs can affect not just the trans-
formed cell niche within a tumor but also the untransformed 
cellular microenvironment in ways that engender disease 
progression. Stromal constituents such as endothelial cells 
and bone marrow-derived cells signal in response to chemo-
therapeutic exposure to accentuate metastasis [13– 16]. In 
this context, it is pertinent to study whether senescence in 
stromal constituents due to drug exposure contributes to can-
cer cell invasion. Indeed, the accumulation of senescent/aged 
mesothelia, the cells lining the peritoneal cavity, has been 
shown to aid ovarian cancer metastasis [17].
In this study, we sought to ask whether chemotherapeutic 
drugs can drive mesothelial cells to senescence with an unin-
tended potentiation of cancer progression. Using a human-
murine hybrid ex vivo system, human mesothelial-cancer 
coculture system and a Cellular Potts Model (CPM)-based 
multiscale framework, we found that the senescent meso-
thelia secrete a unique matrisome that provides a habitable 
niche for metastasizing cancer cells. A comprehensive 
understanding of how such a ‘senescence-associated matri-
somal phenotype’ leads to higher invasion by ovarian cancer 
will help design novel therapeutics for the management of 
metastasis.
Results
Senescent mesothelial monolayers potentiate 
adhesion of ovarian cancer cells
Parietal peritoneal tissue was dissected from 4 to 6 week 
Balb/c female mice and cultivated ex vivo as described 
earlier [18]. Senescence was induced in the explants 
using 100 nM doxorubicin. Mesothelial cells were har -
vested from control and senescent murine peritonea and 
senescence was confirmed by morphological examina-
tion (Figure S1A). Control and senescent explants were 
cultivated with a suspension of GFP-expressing SKOV-3 
cells and the adhesion of the latter assessed (Fig.  1A). 
SKOV-3 cells were observed to attach faster to the 
senescent murine peritoneum than untreated controls 
(Fig.  1Bi-ii; statistical significance shown in Fig.  1Biii).

We did not observe any notable difference in acellular spaces 
between control and senescent mesothelial monolayers prior 
to the adhesion of cancer cells, which suggested that clear -
ance rather than available adherable space could play a role 
in a greater cancer cell occupancy within senescent cell 
populations.
To confirm that the clearance of senescent MeT-5A 
monolayers is indeed caused by SKOV-3 cells, a senescent 
monolayer without SKOV-3 cells was also imaged for 72 h 
(Figure S4A; see also video S3). We observed a significant 
reduction in the area occupied by senescent MeT-5A mon-
olayers in the presence of SKOV-3 cells compared to SKOV-
3-less controls (Fig.  2Di and Figure S4B). To confirm the 
ability of ovarian cancer cells to clear, and proliferate amidst, 
senescent mesothelia, GFP-expressing OVCAR-3 cells were 
cultivated with senescent and control MeT-5A monolay -
ers for 60 h (Figure S5A and S5B). We observed higher 
proliferation of OVCAR-3 cells within senescent MeT-5A 
monolayers (Figure S5Ci-ii) and a significant reduction in 
the area occupied by senescent MeT-5A monolayers com-
pared with control MeT-5A monolayers (Figure S5Di-ii). 
We also observed a substantial decrease in the area occupied 
by senescent MeT-5A monolayers cultured with OVCAR-3 
cancer cells compared with senescent MeT-5A monolayers 
where with OVCAR-3 cells were not added (Figure S5E-F 
and Di).
Multiple cancer cells surround and clear senescent 
mesothelia independent of confluence
Extrusion of cells within populations is well known across 
developmental and oncological contexts and is often driven 
through cell-density dependent mechanisms [19, 20]. We 
asked if the clearance of mesothelia was achieved by can-
cer cells only when both were part of a jammed confluent 
population. To answer this question, we examined our epif-
luorescence time-lapses and observed senescent cell extru-
sions by SKOV-3 cells even in sub-confluent conditions 
(Fig.  3A). We found that the total number of extrusions 
in senescent MeT-5A monolayers with SKOV-3 cells was 
significantly higher than the total number of extrusions in 
control MeT-5A monolayers with SKOV-3 cells and senes-
cent MeT-5A monolayers without SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 3B). 
Moreover, we observed that a significant number of extruded 
senescent MeT-5A were surrounded and impacted by more 
than one SKOV-3 cell before their clearance (Fig.  3C). To 
our surprise, we also observed that senescent cells distant 
from SKOV-3 cells showed a lower frequency for extru-
sion (similar to non-senescent cells in controls distant from 
SKOV-3 cells. This suggested that the extrusion of senescent 
mesothelial cells was strongly correlated with their proxim-
ity with ovarian cancer cells.
To further characterize cellular neighborhoods within 
coculture monolayers, we determined the total number and 
type of neighbors for senescent and non-senescent mesothe-
lia within cocultures. Due to their larger surface area, the 
number of neighbors for senescent cells is naturally higher 
(~ 4–5 cells) than for non-senescent cells (~ 2–3 cells). Nev-
ertheless, the proportion of neighboring cells being cancer 
cells was found to be significantly higher for senescent 
mesothelia than their counterpart non-senescent cells in the 
same fields (Fig. 3D).
Our observation that cancer cells can clear mesothelia 
independent of cell crowding effects suggested that conflu-
ence dependent cell extrusion may not be operative here. 
This surmise was reinforced by our observation of a closer 
localization of cancer cells to senescent mesothelia. To shed 
light on the intercellular interactions that allow confluence-
agnostic senescent cell shedding, we employed a multiscale 
virtual tissue simulation approach using the Cellular Potts 
Model (CPM)-based computational framework Compu-
cell3D. A monolayer consisting of senescent, non-senescent, 
and cancer cells was simulated initially, incorporating dif -
ferences in their cell proliferation rates and relative cell size. 
The simulation period in Monte-Carlo steps (MCS) was cali-
brated with experiments by comparing the growth of cancer 
cells in the experiments to the growth rate of cancer cells 
in simulations. The size and number of each cell type was 
quantified based on their initial starting conditions in experi-
ments. Our first model (Fig. 4Bi; video S4) incorporated no 
other interactive rule. It was, therefore, not surprising that 
the first model resulted in a confluent monolayer without 
any colocalization of cancer cells and senescent cells and 
without any clearance of the latter. Based on our observa -
tions in Fig. 3A, we incorporated an additional rule (Model 
2, Fig. 4Bii; video S5), wherein clearance of senescent cells 
could occur if they share >  = 55% of their perimeter with 
cancer cells. This did result in the extrusion of senescent 
cells, but only after cancer cells had proliferated enough to 
create a confluent cocultured monolayer. Therefore, clear -
ance occurred much after confluence had been reached. This 
led us to hypothesize that an effective attractive force may 
exist between senescent and cancer cells, driving them to 
localize close to each other (consistent with our experimen-
tal observations of their proximity). Solely implementing 
such an attractive force (through decreasing the contact 
energy of adhesion between the senescent and cancer cells; 
 CEnew = 15, while  CEold = 30) was insufficient for mesothe-
lial clearance (Model 3, Fig. 4Biii; video S6). However, the 
simultaneous implementation of adhesive attraction between 
senescent and cancer cells and the rule for extrusion (Model 
4, Fig. 4Biv; video S7) brought about clearance even when 
the monolayers were sub-confluent, similar to what we 
observed in experiments (as shown in Fig. 4C, D). We next 
asked whether senescent cells secreted any chemoattractants

199 media (HiMedia; AL014A) along with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (Gibco; 10,270) were used for conditioned media 
growth assay with SKOV-3 cancer cells.
Senescent and non‑senescent matrix preparation
Senescent and non-senescent MeT-5A cells were seeded at 
high confluency on chamber wells with coverslip bottoms. 
The cells were allowed to adhere and lay down the extracel-
lular matrix for the next 36 h. The confluent MeT-5A mon-
olayers were then washed with 1 × PBS twice and decellular-
ized using a 20 mM solution of  NH4OH in Milli-Q water for 
7–10 min [49]. The cellular debris was gently removed by 
giving 2–3 washes with Milli-Q water. The extracted extra-
cellular matrices laid on the chamber wells were used for 
adhesion assays.
Adhesion assay with RGD peptide
The SKOV-3 cells (5000 in number) suspended in Mcoy’s 
5A media (HiMedia; AL057A) along with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (Gibco; 10,270) were added to the decellularized 
senescent and non-senescent matrices and allowed to adhere 
on the matrix for 25 min. For adhesion assay with RGD pep-
tide, the media also had cyclic RGD peptide (Sigma; G1269-
1MG) at 10 and 20 μg/mL concentrations. After incubation, 
the wells were washed with 1 × PBS twice and immediately 
imaged by using an Olympus IX83 inverted epifluorescence 
microscope at 10 × magnification. The images were ana-
lyzed and the number of cells adhered to the matrices was 
counted using the “analyze particles” feature in ImageJ. The 
attached cells were also time-lapsed for 24 h using a Tokai 
Hit stage-top incubator with image acquisition through an 
Orca Flash LT plus camera (Hamamatsu) on an Olympus 
IX73 microscope. The data were analyzed using a manual 
tracking plugin in FIJI and Ibidi’s chemotaxis and migra-
tion tool to see differences in displacement and velocity of 
SKOV-3 cells on senescent and non-senescent matrices (can 
be seen in videos S8 and S9).
Compucell 3D model for the clearance of senescent 
mesothelia
Compucell3D (CC3D) is based on the Cellular Potts Model 
(CPM), also known as the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg (GGH) 
model. It has been utilized extensively for computational 
models of the collective behavior of cellular structures. The 
CPM is a lattice-based discrete model in which spatiotem-
poral development is simulated via an energy minimizing 
procedure [34, 50]. Each cell consists of a collection of lat-
tice sites (pixels). Each configuration is associated with an 
effective energy, or Hamiltonian (H), which is calculated 
based on properties such as volume, surface area, contact 
energies, or external properties. Time evolution is simulated 
via Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) that involve random changes 
of lattice site occupations and the changes that decrease the 
energy are more likely than those that increase it. The Ham-
iltonian of the system is formulated as:
where i, j are lattice sites, /u1D70Ei is the cell at site i, /u1D70F(/u1D70E) is 
the cell type of cell /u1D70E , J is the coefficient determining the 
adhesion between two cells of types /u1D70F(/u1D70E) , /u1D70F(/u1D70E�) , /u1D6FF is the 
Kronecker delta, v( /u1D70E ) is the volume of cell /u1D70E , V(/u1D70E ) is the 
target volume, and /u1D706 is a Lagrange multiplier determining 
the strength of the volume constraint. We utilized a simple 
two-dimensional model 140*140*1 using a square pixel lat-
tice to find and understand the effect of factors sufficient 
to bring a considerable decline in the senescent mesothelia 
area as observed in the mesothelial clearance experiments 
that were recorded using time-lapse epifluorescence videog-
raphy. The simulation time was set to 8000 MCS as per the 
corresponding normalized length of the experimental time-
lapse videos. The lattice is composed of the medium, senes-
cent cells (SEN), non-senescent cells (NON_SEN), ovarian 
cancer cells (CANCER), and a frozen wall that mimics a 
closed system such as enclosed peritoneal cavity (shown 
in figure S12). This simple model has four variations with 
the contact energies between cancer and senescent cells to 
be either 15 (greater adhesion) or 30 (same as other contact 
energy combinations) and activation or deactivation of the 
active extrusion rule (shown in figure S13). The other impor-
tant parameters used in the model and their input values are 
available at Table S2. To compare the simulation time to 
the timescale of senescent mesothelial clearance by ovarian 
cancer cells, a calibration was performed. The division time 
of ovarian cancer cells in experiments (SKOV-3 cells) was 
18 h and the division time of ovarian cancer cells in simula-
tions was 750 MCS. This factor was used to calibrate the 
simulations time to real-time and the comparison between 
the computational model and senescent mesothelial clear -
ance experiments was made.
Statistical analysis
The experiments were repeated at least three times and 
unpaired parametric t-test with Welch’s correction were used 
for statistical testing unless otherwise stated in the figure leg-
ends. The graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 
and p-values < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
